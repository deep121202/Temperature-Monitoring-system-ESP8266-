# DHT11 Sensor:
The DHT11 sensor is a basic and inexpensive digital temperature and humidity sensor commonly used in electronics projects, particularly in the realm of Arduino and other microcontroller-based projects. Here are some key features and characteristics of the DHT11 sensor:
Temperature and Humidity Sensing: The primary function of the DHT11 sensor is to measure both temperature and humidity levels in the surrounding environment. It can provide temperature readings with an accuracy of ±2°C and humidity readings with an accuracy of ±5%.
Digital Output: The DHT11 sensor communicates with microcontrollers using a digital protocol, making it easy to interface with popular platforms like Arduino. It sends data as a serial signal, which can be read by the microcontroller to obtain temperature and humidity values.
Single-Wire Communication: The DHT11 sensor utilizes a single-wire communication protocol, which means it requires only one data pin for both sending and receiving data. This simplicity makes it easy to integrate into projects with limited available pins.
Relatively Simple to Use: The DHT11 sensor is relatively simple to use, especially when compared to more advanced sensors with additional features and capabilities. It typically requires minimal external components and can be connected directly to a microcontroller without the need for additional circuitry.

# Working of Temperature and Humidity Monitoring System using ESP8266 and DHT11:

A Temperature and Humidity Monitoring System using ESP8266 and DHT11 involves integrating the ESP8266 microcontroller board with the DHT11 sensor to measure temperature and humidity levels. The ESP8266 is a low-cost Wi-Fi microcontroller with built-in Wi-Fi capability, making it suitable for IoT (Internet of Things) applications. The DHT11 sensor is a basic digital sensor capable of measuring temperature and humidity.
Hardware Setup:
Connect the DHT11 sensor to the ESP8266 microcontroller board. The DHT11 sensor typically has three pins: VCC, data, and ground. Connect VCC to a 3.3V or 5V pin on the ESP8266 (check the specifications of your specific board), connect ground to a ground pin, and connect the data pin to any GPIO pin on the ESP8266 (e.g., GPIO2).
Power up the ESP8266 board.
Programming the ESP8266:
Write code to read data from the DHT11 sensor using the GPIO pin connected to the data pin of the sensor.
Use the ESP8266's Wi-Fi capabilities to establish a connection to your local Wi-Fi network.
Implement code to send the temperature and humidity data to a server or cloud platform. You can use protocols like MQTT, HTTP, or TCP/IP for communication.
Optionally, implement error handling and data formatting to ensure reliable data transmission.
Data Transmission:
Once the ESP8266 is programmed and connected to Wi-Fi, it will start reading temperature and humidity data from the DHT11 sensor at regular intervals.
The ESP8266 will then transmit this data to the designated server or cloud platform over the Wi-Fi network.
Depending on your implementation, you may choose to transmit data continuously or trigger transmissions based on predefined conditions.
Data Processing and Visualization:
On the server or cloud platform, receive and process the incoming temperature and humidity data.
Store the data in a database for historical analysis and visualization.
Implement a user interface Thingspeak to display real-time and historical temperature and humidity data in a human-readable format.
Optionally, set up alerts or notifications to notify users of critical temperature or humidity conditions.
Monitoring and Maintenance:
Monitor the system regularly to ensure proper functioning of the hardware and software components.
Address any issues that arise, such as connectivity problems or sensor failures.
Update the system as needed to add new features or improve 
performance.
